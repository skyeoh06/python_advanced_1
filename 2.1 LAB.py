print(p1 + p2)

print(p1 + p2)
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'Person'

#The dir() function gives you a quick glance at an objectâ€™s capabilities and returns a list of the attributes and methods of the object.
#To get more help on each attribute and method, issue the help() function on an object

#Object attribute access
#Access to object attributes can be controlled via the following magic methods

Expression example	        Magic method	                        Implementation meaning or purpose
object.attribute	          __getattr__(self, attribute)	        responsible for handling access to a non-existing attribute

del object.attribute	      __delattr__(self, attribute)	        responsible for deleting an attribute

#Methods allowing access to containers
#Containers are any object that holds an arbitrary number of other objects; containers provide a way to access the contained objects and to iterate over them. Container examples: list, dictionary, tuple, and set.

Expression example	        Magic method	                  Implementation meaning or purpose
len(container)	            __len__(self)	                  returns the length (number of elements) of the container
container[key]	            __getitem__(self, key)	        responsible for accessing (fetching) an element identified by the key argument
container[key] = value	    __setitem__(self, key, value)	  responsible for setting a value to an element identified by the key argument
del container[key]	        __delitem__(self, key)	        responsible for deleting an element identified by the key argument
for element in container	  __iter__(self)	                returns an iterator for the container
item in container	          __contains__(self, item)	      responds to the question: does the container contain the selected item?
